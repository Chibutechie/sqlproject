**CREATING A DATABASE FOR A CREDIT UNION BANK**

In this project, I took on the role of a database developer for a credit union bank. The primary objective was to organize the bank's unstructured data into a well-defined database structure, ensuring data integrity and facilitating efficient data management.

**Key Responsibilities**

1. Data Analysis: Conducted a thorough analysis of the credit union's existing data to understand its structure, relationships, and potential inconsistencies.
Database Design: Designed a relational database schema to accommodate the credit union's data requirements, including tables for customer information, accounts, transactions, loans, and other relevant entities.

2. Data Migration: Migrated the existing unstructured data into the newly designed database, ensuring data accuracy and completeness throughout the process.
Data Integrity: Implemented data integrity constraints, such as primary and foreign keys, to maintain referential integrity and prevent data duplication or inconsistencies.

3. Query Optimization: Optimized database queries and indexed relevant columns to improve query performance and enhance the overall system's efficiency.
Documentation: Documented the database design, data migration process, and relevant SQL queries for future reference and maintenance purposes.
Technologies Used


Database Management System: For this project, I used MS SQL Server but this time I used the extension on VS Code because I preferred how the environment looked compared to SSMS, lol.

SQL Dialect: I write most of my script using TSQL


**USAGE**

Writing the queries for the database, I made sure to include specific constraints for queries that were important. For example, I made sure I specified columns that had primary keys and should be unique, I also included columns that were foreign keys and referenced the primary tables. I made sure to apply the "NOT NULL" constraints which helps guide future users and data entry officers too. 

As I said, Constraints serve as a data validation system in a database guiding the users and data entry officers to know what to do in each column, table and the database itself. 

**CONTRIBUTIONS**

This is my first project, and there could be mistakes I made or things I could have done better. Please feel free to contribute your quota, as this helps me become a better bender ðŸ˜‰. 

I will be looking forward to seeing y'all contribute to this project. 

And oh, I'm going to be modifying the database each time, let's see how far we could go with that. Might build my own Rome.

16/06/2024 - I'm making my last commit to this project today cause I couldn't continue.

What I did basically in this project involves creating a database, adding tables to the db, inserting data into the tables, then i wrote queries for retrieving the data from the database, created views, did a little thing with joins and subqueries. 

I'm moving on to do a guided project cause I haven't really grasped everything I need to know on SQL.
